// On my honor:

// or any other unauthorized source, either modified or
// unmodified.
//
// - All source code and documentation used in my program is
// either my original work, or was derived by me from the
// source code published in the textbook for this course.
//
// - I have not discussed coding details about this project with
// anyone other than my partner (in the case of a joint
// submission), instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the TAs assigned
// to this course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts
// of this program with other students, and that another student
// may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes
// anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file
// during the discussion. I have violated neither the spirit nor
// letter of this restriction.
